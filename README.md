# DEV Challenge

Create a program in Node.js where the input defined in input.csv is parsed and organized into the content shown in output.json.

## Requirements
1. Write your program in only one file (like index.js) and write the output to a file (output.json) instead of printing it to logs or on the screen.
2. JSON order is not important, but its content is. The program should output the same content (not necessarily the same order) if column order is changed.
3. Don't hard code the tags shown, meaning tags could be changed to "email Responsible Parent Pedagogical Financial" and it should still parse accordingly.
